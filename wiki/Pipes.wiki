#summary Process creation and pipes

= Introduction =

An external process can be launched and controlled by the `Process` type. 
It allows to read the process standard output as well as write on the process standard input.



= Launching a process =

A process can be launched and controlled by the limited type
`Process`.  First, let's declare the process instance:

{{{
with Util.Processes;
...
   Proc : Util.Processes.Process;
}}}

The process is launched by the `Spawn` procedure.  The command and its arguments to execute is passed as a string to the procedure.

{{{
   Proc.Spawn ("gnatmake --version");
}}}

Once the process is spawned, the procedure returns: it does not wait for the process to terminate.  We have to use the `Wait` procedure:

{{{
   Proc.Wait;
}}}

Then, the process exit status is obtained by calling `Get_Exit_Status`.
