a sum of time spent for all the measure.

   Perf : Util.Measures.Measure_Set;

= Measure the implementation =

A measure is made by creating a variable of type *Stamp*.  The declaration of
this variabe marks the begining of the measure.  The measure ends at the
next call to *Report* 

{{{
with Util.Measures;
...
   declare
      S : Util.Measures.Stamp;
   begin
      ...
      Util.Measures.Report (Perf, S, "Measure for a block");
   end;
}}}

= Reporting results =



{{{
   Util.Measures.Write (Perf, "Title of measures",
                        Ada.Text_IO.Standard_Output);
}}}
